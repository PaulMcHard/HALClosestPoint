# HALClosestPoint
Exercise for HAL Robotics - Closest Point to Curve

Please find within my submission for the provided exercise. Some notes on the design of the solution:

I have deliberately chosen to focus on creating the Classes for each object - Coordinate, Line, Polyline - in order to provide the desired demonstration of good OOP program design.
Without over-engineering the solution I've tried to demonstrate concepts such as inheritance, polymorphism, appropriate use of access modifiers etc.
Given the short time recommended for the task, I've kept this as a purely CLI task, no GUI to me suggested to leave it not even as a Windows Forms app. 
Apologies for the parts in Main for accepting user input, they are not as rigorous as I would want them to be but this is simply to get a functioning read/write from CLI, it *will* fall over if bad input given.

I hope this is a solution in keeping with what is expected. Thank you for your consideration!

Paul
